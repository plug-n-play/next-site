## Finally

Now we've learned how to create dynamic pages using query strings. This is just the start.

A dynamic page might need more information to render, and we may not be able to pass all of them via query strings. Or we may want to have clean URLs like this: http://localhost:3000/blog/hello-nextjs

We will learn all about these things in upcoming lessons. This is the base for all of them.

export default ({ children }) => <Layout meta={meta}>{children}</Layout>;
