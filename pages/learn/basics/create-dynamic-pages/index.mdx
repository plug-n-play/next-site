import Layout from '../../../../components/learn/Layout';

export const meta = {
  title: 'Create Dynamic Pages',
  courseId: 'basics',
  lessonId: 'create-dynamic-pages'
};

Now we know how to create a basic Next.js app with multiple pages. In order to create a page, we have to create an actual file on the disk.

However, in a real app, we need to create pages dynamically in order to display dynamic content. There are many approaches to do that with Next.js.

We'll start creating dynamic pages by using **query strings**.

We'll be creating a simple blog app. It has a list of all the posts on the home (index) page.

When you click on a post title, you'll be able to see the individual post on its own view.

Let's build that app.

export default ({ children }) => <Layout meta={meta}>{children}</Layout>;
