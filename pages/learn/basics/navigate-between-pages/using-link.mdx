## Using Link

Now we are going to use `next/link` to link our two pages.

Add the following code into `pages/index.js`

```jsx
// This is the Link API
import Link from 'next/link';

const Index = () => (
  <div>
    <Link href="/about">
      <a>About Page</a>
    </Link>
    <p>Hello Next.js</p>
  </div>
);

export default Index;
```

Here we've imported `next/link` as `Link` and use it like this:

```jsx
<Link href="/about">
  <a>About Page</a>
</Link>
```

Now try to visit http://localhost:3000/

Then click the "About Page" link. It will navigate you to the "About" page.

> This is client-side navigation; the action takes place in the browser, without making a request to the server.
> You can verify this by opening your browser's network request inspector.

Okay, now we have a simple task for you:

- Visit http://localhost:3000/
- Then click the "About Page"
- Then hit your browser's Back button

How would you best describe the experience of the Back button?

export default ({ children }) => <Layout meta={meta}>{children}</Layout>;
