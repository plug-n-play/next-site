## Link is Just a Higher Order Component (HOC)

Actually, the title prop on `next/link` component has no effect. That's because `next/link` is just a [higher order component](https://reactjs.org/docs/higher-order-components.html) which only accepts the `href` and some similar props. If you need to add props to it, you need to do it to the underlying component. Do not expect the `next/link` component to pass those props to its children.

In this case, the child of the `next/link` component is the anchor tag. It can also work with any other component or tag, the only requirement for components placed inside `<Link />` is that they should accept an `onClick` prop.

export default ({ children }) => <Layout meta={meta}>{children}</Layout>;
