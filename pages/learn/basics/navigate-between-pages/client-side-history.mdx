## Client-Side History Support

When you hit the Back button, it navigates the page to the index page entirely via the client; `next/link` does all the [`location.history`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History_API) handling for you.

You don't need to write even a single line of client-side routing code.

Simply link pages; it just works!

export default ({ children }) => <Layout meta={meta}>{children}</Layout>;
