## Deploying to Your Own Environment

Like we mentioned at the start, you can also deploy your Next.js app to your own environment.

The following sections of this lesson will teach you how to build and run a Next.js app yourself in production.

export default ({ children }) => <Layout meta={meta}>{children}</Layout>;
