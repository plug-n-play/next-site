import Layout from '../../../../components/learn/Layout';

export const meta = {
  title: 'Deploying a Next.js App',
  courseId: 'basics',
  lessonId: 'deploying-a-nextjs-app',
  stepId: 'setup'
};

First of all, we need a Next.js app to play with. Download the following example app:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zeit/next-learn-demo.git
cd next-learn-demo
cd 8-deploying
```

You can preview the application in development mode by running:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

You can press <kbd>ctrl + c</kbd> in your terminal to stop the development server when you're ready to move on.

export default ({ children }) => <Layout meta={meta}>{children}</Layout>;
