## Build and Start

Let's take a look into the `scripts` in `package.json`:

```json
"scripts": {
  "dev": "next",
  "build": "next build",
  "start": "next start"
}
```

First of all, we need to build our Next.js app for production. It will produce an optimized set of code for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

Then, you need to start your Next.js app on a port. This server will do server-side rendering and serve static pages (built with the above command).

For that, now run the `start` script:

```bash
npm run start
```

Now you can see our app running here: http://localhost:3000

export default ({ children }) => <Layout meta={meta}>{children}</Layout>;
