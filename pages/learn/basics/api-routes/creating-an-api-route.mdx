## Creating an API route

Let's start by creating a file called `pages/api/randomQuote.js`. Then open it and add the following content:

```js
export default (req, res) => {
  res.status(200).json({
    quote: 'Write tests, not too many, mostly integration',
    author: 'Guillermo Rauch'
  });
};
```

The above API route returns a json with a quote and its author, `res.status` and `res.json` are custom [response helpers](https://github.com/zeit/next.js#helper-functions) added by Next.js.

Now open your browser and go to http://localhost:3000/api/randomQuote.

What do you see in the browser?

export default ({ children }) => <Layout meta={meta}>{children}</Layout>;
