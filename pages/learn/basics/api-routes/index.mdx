import Layout from '../../../../components/learn/Layout';

export const meta = {
  title: 'API Routes',
  courseId: 'basics',
  lessonId: 'api-routes'
};

In this lesson, we will learn how to create and consume an API in the same Next.js app.

Before moving forward, learn more about [Fetching Data for Pages](/learn/basics/fetching-data-for-pages), we'll be fetching API routes inside our pages.

We'll create a simple API which returns a list of famous quotes, and gets rendered on our Next.js app. The finished app will look like this:

Let's get started.

export default ({ children }) => <Layout meta={meta}>{children}</Layout>;
