import Layout from '../../../../components/learn/Layout';

export const meta = {
  title: 'Finally',
  courseId: 'basics',
  lessonId: 'api-routes',
  stepId: 'finally'
};

In this lesson we learned that apart from creating front-end code in a NextJS App, we can also create APIs in the same mono-repo.

The collacation of both APIs and front-end logic in the same codebase is extremely powerful and gives an excellent developer experience.

In this example, we had created hard-coded data in the same codebase. Additionally, we can fetch the data from a remote database as well.

Let's learn about deploying Next.js apps.

export default ({ children }) => <Layout meta={meta}>{children}</Layout>;
