## Finally

In this lesson you have learned to build an API with Next.js, by doing so, it's possible to have your backend and UI in the same app.

We have a simple API and we're only doing GET requests, but you can extend API Routes with pretty much anything, because API Routes are simple HTTP request handlers.

Next.js will take care of building the serverless functions for you, so you can focus on building production grade APIs.

export default ({ children }) => <Layout meta={meta}>{children}</Layout>;
