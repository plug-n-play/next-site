## What Next

We have just scratched the surface with styled-jsx here, and there is a lot more that you can do. Refer to the [styled-jsx](https://github.com/zeit/styled-jsx) GitHub repo for more info.

There are a number of [other styling solutions](https://github.com/zeit/next.js#css-in-js) for Next.js that are pretty good, so have a look at them too.

export default ({ children }) => <Layout meta={meta}>{children}</Layout>;
