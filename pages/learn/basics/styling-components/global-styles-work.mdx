## Global Styles Work

Yep that worked well. It worked, because our styles applied globally.

While this feature can be incredibly handy, we always recommend trying to write scoped styles (without the global prop).

Still, this is a great solution over normal style tags. With styled-jsx all necessary prefixing and CSS validation is done inside a babel plugin, so there is no additional runtime overhead.

export default ({ children }) => <Layout meta={meta}>{children}</Layout>;
