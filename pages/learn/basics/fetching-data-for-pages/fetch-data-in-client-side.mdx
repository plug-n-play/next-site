## Fetch Data in Client Side

Here we can only see the message on the browser console. That's because we navigated to the post page via the client side.

When we click on a link wrapped with the Next.js `<Link>` component, the page transition takes place in the browser, without making a request to the server.

If you just visit a post page directly (eg:- http://localhost:3000/p/975) you'll be able to see the message printed on the server but not in the client.

export default ({ children }) => <Layout meta={meta}>{children}</Layout>;
