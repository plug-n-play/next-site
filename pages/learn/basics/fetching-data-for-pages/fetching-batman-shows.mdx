## Fetching Batman Shows

In our demo app, we have a list of blog posts on the home page. Now we are going to display a list of Batman TV shows.
Instead of hardcoding those shows, we are going to fetch them from a remote server.

> Here we are using the [TVMaze API](http://www.tvmaze.com/api) to fetch those TV shows.
> It's an API to search for TV shows information.

First of all we need to install [isomorphic-unfetch](https://github.com/developit/unfetch). That's the library we are going to use to fetch data. It's a simple implementation of the browser [fetch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch) API, but works both in client and server environments.

```bash
npm install --save isomorphic-unfetch
```

Then replace `pages/index.js` with the following content:

```jsx
import Layout from '../components/MyLayout';
import Link from 'next/link';
import fetch from 'isomorphic-unfetch';

const Index = props => (
  <Layout>
    <h1>Batman TV Shows</h1>
    <ul>
      {props.shows.map(show => (
        <li key={show.id}>
          <Link href="/p/[id]" as={`/p/${show.id}`}>
            <a>{show.name}</a>
          </Link>
        </li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  </Layout>
);

Index.getInitialProps = async function() {
  const res = await fetch('https://api.tvmaze.com/search/shows?q=batman');
  const data = await res.json();

  console.log(`Show data fetched. Count: ${data.length}`);

  return {
    shows: data.map(entry => entry.show)
  };
};

export default Index;
```

Everything on the above page will be familiar to you except `Index.getInitialProps` as shown below:

```jsx
Index.getInitialProps = async function() {
  const res = await fetch('https://api.tvmaze.com/search/shows?q=batman');
  const data = await res.json();

  console.log(`Show data fetched. Count: ${data.length}`);

  return {
    shows: data.map(entry => entry.show)
  };
};
```

That's a static async function you can add into any page in your app. Using that, we can fetch data and send them as props to our page.

As you can see, now we are fetching Batman TV shows and passing them into our page as the 'shows' prop.

As you can see in the above `getInitialProps` function, it prints the number of data fetched to the console.
Now, have a look at both the browser console (in the DevTools) and server console (in the Terminal where you ran the app).
Then reload the page.

Where did you see the message that displays the data count, printed _after_ page reload?

export default ({ children }) => <Layout meta={meta}>{children}</Layout>;
