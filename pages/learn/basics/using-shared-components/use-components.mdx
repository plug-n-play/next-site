## Using Components

We've mentioned two use cases for shared components:

1. As common header components.
2. As Layouts.

You can use components for styling, page layouts, and any other tasks you like. Additionally, you can import components from NPM modules and use them.

export default ({ children }) => <Layout meta={meta}>{children}</Layout>;
