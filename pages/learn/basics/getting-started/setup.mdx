## Setup

Next.js works with Windows, Mac and Linux alike. You only need to have Node.js installed on your system to begin building Next.js applications.

Besides that you need to have a text editor to write code, and a Terminal application to invoke some commands.

> If you are on Windows, try to use PowerShell or Git Bash (Comes with [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)).
> Next.js works with any shell or terminal, but we'll be using some UNIX-specific commands in this guide.
> We recommend using PowerShell to make it easy to follow along.

To start, create a sample project by running the following commands:

```bash
mkdir hello-next
cd hello-next
npm init -y
npm install --save react react-dom next
mkdir pages
```

Then open the `package.json` file in the `hello-next` directory and replace `scripts` with the following:

```json
"scripts": {
  "dev": "next",
  "build": "next build",
  "start": "next start"
}
```

Now everything is ready. Run the following command to start the dev server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/) from your favourite browser.

What's the output you see on the screen?

export default ({ children }) => <Layout meta={meta}>{children}</Layout>;
