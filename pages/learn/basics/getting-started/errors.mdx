## Handling Errors

By default, Next.js will track errors like these and show it in the browser. This helps you identify errors and fix them quickly.

Once you fix the issue, the page will appear instantly without a full page reload. We do this with the help of Webpack's [hot module replacement](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/hot-module-replacement/) facility, which is supported in Next.js by default.

export default ({ children }) => <Layout meta={meta}>{children}</Layout>;
