## Creating Our First Page

Now let's create our first page.

Create a file named `pages/index.js` and add the following content:

```jsx
const Index = () => (
  <div>
    <p>Hello Next.js</p>
  </div>
);

export default Index;
```

Now if you visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/) again, you'll see a page with "Hello Next.js"

Here, we've exported a simple React Component from the `pages/index.js` module. Likewise, you could write your own React component and export it.

> Make sure your React Component is the **default** export.

Now try to prompt a syntax error in your Index page. Here's an example:
(We have simply removed the **&#x3C;/p&#x3E;** HTML tag)

```jsx
const Index = () => (
  <div>
    <p>Hello Next.js
  </div>
)

export default Index
```

What will happen to the app loaded at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/)?

export default ({ children }) => <Layout meta={meta}>{children}</Layout>;
