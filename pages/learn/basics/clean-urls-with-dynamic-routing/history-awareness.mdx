import Layout from '../../../../components/learn/Layout';

export const meta = {
  title: 'Clean URLs with Dynamic Routing',
  courseId: 'basics',
  lessonId: 'clean-urls-with-dynamic-routing',
  stepId: 'history-awareness'
};

## History Awareness

As you have witnessed, dynamic routing works pretty nicely with the browser history, all you have to do is to add the `as` prop to the link component.

export default ({ children }) => <Layout meta={meta}>{children}</Layout>;
