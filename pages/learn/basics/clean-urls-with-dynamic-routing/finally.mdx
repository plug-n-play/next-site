## Finally

That's the end of this lesson, if you want to know more about dynamic routing check out the [dynamic-routing example](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/tree/canary/examples/dynamic-routing) in the Next.js repo and the [documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs#dynamic-routing).

Our next lesson is about dynamic data fetching. Let's add some data now.

export default ({ children }) => <Layout meta={meta}>{children}</Layout>;
