## Finally

Frankly, this example is not the perfect use case for lazy loading. That is simply because,

- You need the `firebase/app` and `firebase/database` modules in all of the pages.
- Lazy loaded modules reduce the size of the main JavaScript bundle `app.js`,
  but they don't affect the initial page loading time since the page is server rendered.
- Loading of the main JavaScript bundle doesn't block the initial HTML rendering

The only benefit this gives us, is the quick JavaScript interactivity because the `app.js` loads faster due to the reduced size.

Anyway, this is a pretty good example where we can demonstrate the lazy loading module. And now you know how to use it in your app when it is needed.

export default ({ children }) => <Layout meta={meta}>{children}</Layout>;
