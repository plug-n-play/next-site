## Analyze

The app will look like this and it is a pretty basic one:

Now, let's try to understand what is inside our app bundle.

For that, simply run the following command:

```bash
npm run analyze
```

Then, it will use [webpack bundle analyzer](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/tree/canary/packages/next-bundle-analyzer) to analyze the pages in a build. You should be able to access the analyses in the `.next/analyze` folder.

In the analysis for the client build (`.next/analyze/client.html`). Where are the Firebase modules contained?

export default ({ children }) => <Layout meta={meta}>{children}</Layout>;
