## Test Result

As you have witnessed, it only loads when you navigate a page for the first time. Here is what is actually happening.

At the first time, the `getInitialProps` in the page `pages/p/[id].js` imports the `firebase/app` and `firebase/database` modules (via `lib/load-db.js`). So, the app loads the bundle.

The second time, the page `pages/index.js` imports the `firebase/app` and `firebase/database` modules. But at that time, they are already loaded and there is no reason to load them again.

export default ({ children }) => <Layout meta={meta}>{children}</Layout>;
