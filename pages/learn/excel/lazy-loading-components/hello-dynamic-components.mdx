## Hello Dynamic Components

In this app, we've isolated markdown rendering into a React [Higher Order Component](https://reactjs.org/docs/higher-order-components.html) (HOC).
It's located at `lib/with-post.js`. Here's the content of that file:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import MyLayout from '../components/MyLayout';
import marked from 'marked';
import Highlight from 'react-highlight';

marked.setOptions({
  gfm: true,
  tables: true,
  breaks: true
});

export default function WithPost(options) {
  return class PostPage extends React.Component {
    render() {
      return (
        <MyLayout>
          <h1>{options.title}</h1>
          <div>
            <Highlight innerHTML>{marked(options.content)}</Highlight>
          </div>
        </MyLayout>
      );
    }
  };
}
```

You can visit `pages/p/hello-nextjs.js` and see how we are using this HOC.

Now we are trying to convert the above `Highlight` component into a **dynamic component**. Dynamic components are powered by the [dynamic imports](https://nextjs.org/docs#dynamic-import) in Next.js.

Most importantly, these components will be loaded only when they are about to be rendered in your app.

Creating a dynamic component is simple. You can use the [`next/dynamic`](https://nextjs.org/docs#dynamic-import) utility.

Here's how you can convert `Highlight` into a dynamic component:

```jsx
//import Highlight from 'react-highlight'
import dynamic from 'next/dynamic';

const Highlight = dynamic(() => import('react-highlight'));
```

That's all you have to do.
Apply the above code change in `lib/with-post.js`.

Then try to start your app again and access http://localhost:3000/p/hello-nextjs. You'll be able to find `react-highlight` in a separate bundle.

Now try to visit http://localhost:3000/p/learn-nextjs and see whether it loads the bundle with `react-highlight` .

Select the correct statement regarding `react-highlight` bundle based on what you've experienced.

export default ({ children }) => <Layout meta={meta}>{children}</Layout>;
