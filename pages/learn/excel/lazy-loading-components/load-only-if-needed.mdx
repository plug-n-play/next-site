## Load Only If Needed

Now we are trying to use the `Highlight` component only when it's needed.

This is the modified `WithPost` HOC which uses the `Highlight` component only when needed.

```jsx
export default function WithPost(options) {
  return class PostPage extends React.Component {
    renderMarkdown() {
      // If a code snippet contains in the markdown content
      // then use Highlight component
      if (/~~~/.test(options.content)) {
        return (
          <div>
            <Highlight innerHTML>{marked(options.content)}</Highlight>
          </div>
        );
      }

      // If not, simply render the generated HTML from markdown
      return <div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: marked(options.content) }} />;
    }

    render() {
      return (
        <MyLayout>
          <h1>{options.title}</h1>
          {this.renderMarkdown()}
        </MyLayout>
      );
    }
  };
}
```

Try to apply the above change to `lib/with-post.js` and start your app again.

Then visit http://localhost:3000/p/learn-nextjs. The app won't download the bundle with `react-highlight`.
But if you visit http://localhost:3000/p/hello-nextjs, it will download the bundle.

---

Now we have a simple task for you. Run your app in production mode with:

```bash
npm run build
npm run start
```

Open a blank page in Chrome with "Network Inspect" selected in the dev console.

Then visit <http://localhost:3000/>.
After the page loads, click “Hello Next.js” title.

Select the correct statement regarding the `react-highlight` bundle based on what you experienced:

export default ({ children }) => <Layout meta={meta}>{children}</Layout>;
