};

## Setup

To start, create a sample project by running the following commands:

```bash
mkdir hello-next
cd hello-next
npm init -y
npm install --save react react-dom next
mkdir pages
```

Now open `package.json` in the `hello-next` directory and replace `scripts` with the following:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "next",
    "build": "next build",
    "start": "next start"
  }
}
```

Let's now add our first page to `pages/index.js`:

```jsx
const Index = () => <h1>Hello World</h1>;
export default Index;
```

We now have a working app, let's build it with `next build`:

```bash
npm run build
```

What happened after you built the app?

export default ({ children }) => <Layout meta={meta}>{children}</Layout>;
