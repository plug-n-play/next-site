Now you know how `next build` works and how it can automatically choose what the ideal build output for each page is. Here are some good tips to help make sure the ideal output is chosen:

- In most cases you don't need a custom server, so try to add `target: 'serverless'` whenever possible
- `getInitialProps` is the main deciding factor for whether a page is static or not, don't add it if you don't need SSR
- Not all dynamic data has to have SSR, e.g if it's behind a login, or if you don't need SEO on it, for cases like that it can be better to do the fetching outside `getInitialProps` and get the benefits of static HTML

export default ({ children }) => <Layout meta={meta}>{children}</Layout>;
