[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) has support for [TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/) out of the box, making it possible to have type checking and other amazing features like:

- Types for Next.js internals like `next/head`, `next/router` and pages
- Almost no setup, Next.js will do all the heavy lifting for you
- You can leverage all the power of TypeScript in your app without limitations, this includes a better developer experience, the amazing VS Code ecosystem and more

Next.js is made with TypeScript, we love it and we want you to use it too, let's get started!

export default ({ children }) => <Layout meta={meta}>{children}</Layout>;
