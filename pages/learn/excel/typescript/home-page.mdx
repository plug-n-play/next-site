import Layout from '../../../../components/learn/Layout';

export const meta = {
  title: 'TypeScript',
  courseId: 'excel',
  lessonId: 'typescript',
  stepId: 'home-page',
  question: {
    answers: [
      'Hello world! - user agent: {userAgent}',
      'Hello world! - user agent: undefined',
      '404 - This page could not be found',
      'Failed to compile because of missing types'
    ],
    correctAnswer: 'Failed to compile because of missing types'
  }
};

## Home Page

Our `index.tsx` page is working without issues, but it's quite simple, let's add `getInitialProps` to it:

```tsx
const Home = ({ userAgent }) => <h1>Hello world! - user agent: {userAgent}</h1>;

Home.getInitialProps = async ({ req }) => {
  const userAgent = req ? req.headers['user-agent'] : navigator.userAgent;
  return { userAgent };
};

export default Home;
```

Now if you go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/) you'll see the user agent used by the browser.

Let's change the `strict` field in the `tsconfig.json` file that was generated for us, like so:

```json
"strict": true
```

Now restart the development server, so Next.js can use the updated `tsconfig.json`, and wait for the browser to reload. What's the output in the browser?

export default ({ children }) => <Layout meta={meta}>{children}</Layout>;
