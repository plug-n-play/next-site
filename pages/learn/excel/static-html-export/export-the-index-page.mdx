## Export the Index Page

Now we are going to export our index page (`pages/index.js`) as a static HTML page.

First of all, create a file called `next.config.js` in the root of your app and add the following content:

```js
module.exports = {
  exportTrailingSlash: true,
  exportPathMap: function() {
    return {
      '/': { page: '/' }
    };
  }
};
```

Then open `package.json` and replace `scripts` with the following:

```json
"scripts": {
  "build": "next build",
  "export": "next export"
}
```

Then run the following commands:

```bash
npm run build
npm run export
```

Now you can see the exported HTML content on a directory called `out` inside your project.

That's a fully functioning static web app. You can deploy it to any static hosting service, and it will work fine.
But before we do that, we need to test it out locally.

In order to test the app, install the following [serve](https://www.npmjs.com/package/serve) NPM module globally:

```bash
npm install -g serve
```

> `serve` is a pretty simple static web server. You can also use any other similar tool.
> But to make things simple, use `serve` for this lesson.

After you've installed `serve`, run following commands from the root folder:

```bash
cd out
serve -p 8080
```

Now you can access your static app in http://localhost:8080.
Everything should be working as usual.

Now try to visit this page: http://localhost:8080/show/975

How do you describe the output?

export default ({ children }) => <Layout meta={meta}>{children}</Layout>;
