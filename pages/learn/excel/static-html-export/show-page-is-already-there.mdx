## Show Page is Already There

Next.js won't build the app when running the `next export` command. In this case, the page `/show/[id]` already exists in the build, and there's no need to build the whole app again.

But if we've made any changes to the app, we need to build the app again to get those changes.

export default ({ children }) => <Layout meta={meta}>{children}</Layout>;
