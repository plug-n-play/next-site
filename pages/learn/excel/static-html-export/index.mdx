The best way to deploy your web app is as a static HTML app, if that's possible. With a static app, you can use a fast and efficient web server like [NGINX](https://nginx.org/en/) or a cost-effective static hosting service like [ZEIT now](https://zeit.co/blog/unlimited-static) or GitHub pages.

But not every app can be deployed as a static app. If your app needs to generate dynamic pages at the runtime, you can't deploy it as a static app.

If you can categorize your app as a static app, you can build it with Next.js.
Next.js 3.0 comes with a feature that allows you to export an app into a set of HTML pages.

In this lesson, we are going to explore that feature.
Let's get started.

export default ({ children }) => <Layout meta={meta}>{children}</Layout>;
