## Exporting Other Pages

Now, let's try to export all the other pages as well.

For that, add the following content to the `next.config.js` file:

```js
const fetch = require('isomorphic-unfetch');

module.exports = {
  exportPathMap: async function() {
    const paths = {
      '/': { page: '/' },
      '/about': { page: '/about' }
    };
    const res = await fetch('https://api.tvmaze.com/search/shows?q=batman');
    const data = await res.json();
    const shows = data.map(entry => entry.show);

    shows.forEach(show => {
      paths[`/show/${show.id}`] = { page: '/show/[id]', query: { id: show.id } };
    });

    return paths;
  }
};
```

As is shown in the above config, the `/about` path is very similar to the `/` path. But for the shows we do something a bit different.

Here's what's going on:

To render the shows in our app, we first fetch the list of shows, this is the same fetch we do in `/`. We then loop the shows and add a new path and query for every one of them.

For example for the show of `Batman` with the id `975` the loop will add the following path:

```js
'/show/975': { page: '/show/[id]', query: { id: '975' } }
```

The page `/show/[id]` will then use the `query` object to get the `id` and fetch more info about the show.

Now close the existing app running with serve and run the following commands in the root folder:

```bash
npm run export
cd out
serve -p 8080
```

Now try to access this page: http://localhost:8080/show/975

What's the output in the browser?

export default ({ children }) => <Layout meta={meta}>{children}</Layout>;
