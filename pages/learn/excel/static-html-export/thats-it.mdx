import Layout from '../../../../components/learn/Layout';

export const meta = {

  stepId: 'thats-it'
};

## That's It

This is all about the [static HTML export](https://nextjs.org/docs#static-html-export) feature of Next.js. You can develop your app, usually with `next` (AKA: `npm run dev`), and when it's time to deploy the app, you can export it as a static app.

But if you need to create pages dynamically after you've deploy the app, this is not the solution.
For that, you need to build the app and start it with `next start`

export default ({ children }) => <Layout meta={meta}>{children}</Layout>;
